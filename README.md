# siren

an alternative development framework for monome
[norns](https://monome.org/norns/).

at current it is a common lisp based wrapper around the core of
[matron](https://github.com/monome/norns). the same hardware, usb
device, and event handling code which supports the native lua scripting
environment is exposed to lisp.

_(warning: this is a work in progress)_
